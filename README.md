# Welcome to my Master's Thesis repository!
This place is to store all codes and files for my master's thesis dedicated to _ecotope evolution_ in the Wadden Sea.
> some information will not be uploaded due to privacy reasons and copyright claims

# Summary
To prove the impact of birds on _ecotope evolution_, their composition and distribution are mapped to a system of ecotopes. The last ones will be clustered based on elevation (DEMs by LADAR) and chlorophyll intensity (NDVI by satellites). Data will be processed for 2017-2021 and 11 islands in the Wadden Sea.

# Pipeline
- download data from Planet (API, NDVI), Deltares (directly, DEMs), Rijkswaterstaat (directly, vegetation maps);
- approximate data from different sources into one file and cluster all into several ecotopes;
- assign ecotopes to bird points and track correlations;
- statistics for proving the point.

# To be continued...
Since I am currently working on this project, not all scripts are represented here and they are definitely not in their best condition :)
